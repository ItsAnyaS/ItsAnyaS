### Hi there I'm AnastasiaðŸ‘‹


Full stack software engineer with experience in React, Express, Node, Rails, and SQL. I love building applications from the ground up with a focus on clean code and user experience. I have experience building fast frontends with intuitive UI, server-side applications, and REST APIs.  My most recent project is [Callbck](http://www.callbck.com/).  Callbck is a dance listing website that seeks to fill in the gaps in what is currently out there.  As a dancer you can apply to listings and will be updated everytime a status of your application changes.  You can also where you are in all of your current applications.  As a company you have access to everything about all your applicants in one place.  You can see their headshots, dance reel and resumes all together without downloading anything.  You can also send callbacks, mark people at hired and more.
