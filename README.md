### Hi there, I'm AnastasiaðŸ‘‹

As a ballerina turned full-stack software engineer with expertise in React, Rails, Express, Node, and SQL, I have a solid foundation in designing applications from the ground up with a focus on clean code and user experience. My initial interest in programming was prompted by my experience in the dance industry, where I was captivated by the process of developing a product using synchronous and asynchronous components. 
I've had the chance to work in large groups throughout my prior employment, and as a result, I've acquired a natural grasp of teamwork. This knowledge enables me to successfully manage my team and give them the assistance they require to be successful. My most recent project is [Callbck](http://www.callbck.com/).  Callbck is a dance listing website that seeks to fill in the gaps in what is currently out there.  As a dancer you can apply to listings and will be updated everytime a status of your application changes.  You can also where you are in all of your current applications.  As a company you have access to everything about all your applicants in one place.  You can see their headshots, dance reel and resumes all together without downloading anything. You can also send callbacks, mark people at hired and more.
