### Hi there I'm AnastasiaðŸ‘‹


I am a fullstack developer that loves the entire development process. From brignging designs to life on the frontend, or building REST APIs on the backend, I take pride in my proffessonal work.  My most recent project is [Callbck](http://www.callbck.com/).  Callbck is a dance listing website that seeks to fill in the gaps in what is currently out there.  As a dancer you can apply to listings and will be updated everytime a status of your application changes.  You can also where you are in all of your current applications.  As a company you have access to everything about all your applicants in one place.  You can see their headshots, dance reel and resumes all together without downloading anything.  You can also send callbacks, mark people at hired and more.
